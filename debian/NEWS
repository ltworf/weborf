weborf (0.15-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    The configuration options for the .conf file are slightly different, so
    please make sure that your configuration still works.

    This version comes with .service files for systemd.
    It is now possible to run several instances of weborf, by creating a new
    .conf file in /etc/weborf.d

    So for example, to use both http and https, it is possible to copy
    /etc/weborf.d/weborf.conf into /etc/weborf.d/https.conf, change the port
    and add the path to the SSL certificate.

    The .service file removes some permissions to the executable, if your use
    case requires those permissions, you might experience failures. You can
    override the .service file locally.
