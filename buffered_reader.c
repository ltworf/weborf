This function is designed to be similar to a normal read, but it uses an internal

When the buffer is empty, it will try to fill it.
An important difference from the normal read is that this function will wait until
the requested amount of bytes are available, or until the timeout occurs.
Timeout duration is defined with the READ_TIMEOUT define.
On some special cases, the read data could be less than the requested one. For example if
end of file is reached and it is impossible to do further reads.
