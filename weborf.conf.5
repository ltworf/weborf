.B indexes
By default weborf searches for index.html. Anyway it is possible to specify a different index file and also many index files. Name of the pages must be separated by a comma and between them there aren't spaces.

.TP
.B basedir
Default base directory used by the webserver. The default means that this will be used also when virtual hosts are enabled, if the requested host is unknown. Of course the user used for the webserver will need to have access to this directory.

.TP
.B use-cgi
Can be true or false. If false weborf will handle all files as normal files. Otherwise it will use the CGI protocol to execute some files.

.TP
.B use-mime
Can be true or false. If true weborf will send the Content-Type header to the clients. Turning it off will increase speed but might cause problems with some old clients.
